diff -u is a neater way of using diff than the plain diff I normally use


Git is designed for programming projects containing a large number of changing files. Googledocs is designed for individual unrelated files. A programming commit may have hundreds of changed files in one commit.


git log will show the history of all the changes
git diff (id1) (id2) will show what changed between commits.


git gives the ability to experiment with code, confident an older version can be returned to if the changes don't work or if they break something.

I want to use git to take over the world. Obviously rolling back the changes that don't work.

 git diff considers the first argument as the "original", and the second argument as the "new" version, so additions are lines present in the second argument but not the first.
