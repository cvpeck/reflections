When would I want to create a remote repository? Whenever I want to share my code, or make sure it is backed up somewhere safe.

Why might I want to always pull changes manually? Because the remote code may have changed significantly from what I am developing and I would be required to deconflict each pull. I'd prefer to develop my branch then merge after that.
