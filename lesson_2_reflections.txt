WHen a repository is initialised with git init a .git directory is created containing the metadata for the repository. No files are added to the repository with a commit.
The staging area is an intermediary area where files can be added and removed before finalizing the commit. It give the user the flexibility to sort files out before commiting.
To ensure you only have one commit per logical change you can use the command -
git diff (to compare mods with staging)
git diff --staging (to compare staging with latest commit)
and 
git diff commit1 commit2 (to compare the last commits)


Braches are useful for developing new features that you may not be sure whether are going to be incorporated into the final product, or for ttrying out experimental features.

The diagrams help visualize the branch structure because brains think visually! Nice to see a diagram showing all the branches rather than having to try yo visualise it internally.
